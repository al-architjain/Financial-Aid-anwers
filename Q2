Respected Sir/Ma'am,
I am a very bright student who is always interested to learn new technologies that are related to my engineering degree field, that is, to the Computer Science and Engineering field. By learning these technologies I aim to remove the drawbacks of the current systems and increase their efficiency by collaborating different positive points of different technologies, like, through this course, I can use blockchain to increase the privacy of the current business platforms so that nobody can perform any act of forgery and the people with fewer business skills (like the farmers) are not exploited by the rich.
I have always aimed to make the computer science technologies benefit the society in one way or the other and by learning about blockchain I find this as one of the golden gifts that can help me achieve my goal to the fullest. So, I request you to provide me with financial aid so that I can learn this technology and achieve my goals.
Thank You
Regards
Archit Jain
